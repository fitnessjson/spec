# 1.0.0-alpha.4

fitness·json is a family of data interchange objects based on JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) designed specifically for the storing and sharing of sport, fitness, and health data. It defines several types of JSON objects and how they combine to represent data about athlete's workouts, fitness profile, and guided workout instructions.

Fitness JSON ecosystem is designed for endurance athletes such as runners, cyclists, triathletes, para-triathletes, and alike. The format of the data is friendly to both—computers and humans—and can be easily explored, adjusted, and extended.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is an alpha version of the fitness·json. Things will break, frequently. Spec is not ready for the prime time, or usage in production software.
{% endhint %}

### Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### File Format

Fitness JSON objects can be stored in persistent storage as files. Such self-contained objects must have `version` key at the very top of the root object.

Files should be pretty-printed as it is friendlier to humans. In cases where larger file sizes are an issue, the content may be compacted by stripping the whitespace.

#### File Extensions

`.json` is highly recommended. When this causes issues, `.fitjson` is sensible fallback.  

#### Macintosh UTIs

| File Type | UTI | Parent UTI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Workout | `org.fitnessjson.workout` | `public.json` |
| Guide | `org.fitnessjson.guide` | `public.json` |
| Route | `org.fitnessjson.route` | `public.json` |

### Wordmark and Correct Spelling

**fitness·json** is a wordmark of the format and must be spelled as with `·` [middle dot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C2%B7) glyph between words. Capitalization must be avoided, even if the sentence starts with the wordmark. Whenever usage of the wordmark is impossible or not desired, **Fitness JSON** is a recommended alternative \(note the capital F and JSON\). 

## Workout

The workout object is self-contained and can be represented as a single file. The purpose of the workout object is to contain all completed activities \(with optional guide\) as a single workout along with its completion status, post-workout comments, and athlete's profile at the moment of workout.

### Top Level

Example of the completed workout:

```javascript
{
  "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.4#workout",
  "title": "2019-04-29 [T1] Tempo Run (interrupted)",
  "status": "complete",
  "activities": [
    {
      "sport": "cycle",
      "env": "outdoor",
      "start_date": "date",
      "samples": [
        {
          "t": 123123123,
          "hr": 84,
          "p": 189
        },
        {
          "t": 123123123,
          "hr": 85,
          "p": 174
        },
        {
          "t": 123123123,
          "hr": 83,
          "p": 182
        }
      ],
      "laps": [
        { "t": 1235323, "trigger": "user" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "sport": "run",
      "env": "outdoor",
      "start_date": "date",
      "samples": [
        {
          "t": 123123123,
          "hr": 110,
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The typical workout object contains an array of [activities](../#activity), valid [status](../#activity-options) value, and [version](../#top-level).

Note that the workout's start date is `start_date` of its first activity. Workout with empty `activities` and the status of anything other than `empty` is invalid.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `version` | string | ✓ | The URL of the version of the format the object or file. |
| `title` | string |  | Title of the workout for easy identification. |
| `activities` | [\[activity\]](../#activity) | ✓ | An array of activities that are part of the workout. If the array has more that one activity, the workout is considered to be a multisport __workout. |
| `status` | [status](../#activity-options) | ✓ | The completion status of the workout. |
| `comments` | [\[comment\]](../#comment) |  | Post-workout comments. May contain many [comments](../#comment) from various [people](../#author). |
| `profile` | [profile](../#profile) |  | The snapshot of the profile at the time of the workout completion.[‡]() |
| `guide` | [guide](../#guide) |  | The snapshot of the performed guide. Use with caution—athlete may not want to share this. |
| `route` | [route](../#route) |  | The snapshot of the route that the athlete used during the workout. Use with caution—athlete may not want to share this. |

#### Triathlon and Multisport Transitions

Triathlon and multisport transitions are distinct activities. Such objects have `sport: transition` key-value pair present.

### Workout Status

Workouts may have one of several statuses depending on circumstances when the workout object was persisted.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `empty` | The workout is newly created or has no meaningful data. |
| `incomplete` | The workout has incomplete data. An athlete should have an opportunity to carry-on recording data. |
| `complete` | **Default** value. The workout is complete and must not be modified. |

#### Causes of Incomplete Workout

Incomplete workouts can exist for several reasons. One of those could be a recorder malfunction. Consider the following cases:‌

1. The recorder should write a workout object to persistent storage periodically to minimize data loss in case of a fatal crash.
2. The recorder must set the \`status\` key to \`incomplete\` while recording. Only after an athlete explicitly finishes the workout \(or guided workout finishes running\) \`status\` must be reset to \`complete\`. 
3. When \`status\` is \`incomplete\`, and the recorder is not running, an athlete should have an opportunity to restore the recording state and carry-on activity within a reasonable time interval after the last sample.

### Embedded Profile

Example of a workout with an embedded profile:

```javascript
{
  "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.4#workout",
  "activities": [{ }], // redacted
  "status": "complete",
  "profile": {
    "lthr": 169,
    "ftp": 220,
    "vo2max": 39,
    "weight": 74.4,
  }
}
```

An athlete's fitness level and body measurements change over time, hence the variable nature of fitness **profile** over time. To provide a better context for the workout during the overview or analysis, athletes may include their profile in the workout object.

For instance, let's imagine an athlete preparing for an upcoming cycling event. Her weight three weeks ago was different from the current. Because of that, when she's analyzing data from three weeks old workout, her `w/kg` power measurements must be calculated from the embedded profile that maintains her weight at the time of the workout. This guarantees measurements to match reality at the time of the workout.

### Sharing Workout: Best Practices

Information stored in workout objects and files can be highly sensitive, both from the privacy perspective, as well as the athlete's competitive advantage.

When sharing workout online or with another party, consider the following:

* The sharer should not share object as-is unless the athlete explicitly consents such action.
* The app should provide an opportunity to omit information from the object before sharing it online. Good candidates for removal are the complete profile, cycling power from every sample, comments, partial profile \(e.g., include `weight`, but omit `email` and `ftp`\).

## Activity

Example of redacted activity object:

```javascript
{
  "sport": "cycle",
  "env": "outdoor",
  "start_date": "date",
  "samples": [ ],
  "laps": [ ],
  "markers": [ ]
}
```

The activity object describes one activity of a particular sport performed in a single environment. Examples of activity are _Outdoor Run_, _Indoor Cycle_, _Outdoor Handcycle_, _Open-water Swim_, and _Outdoor \[Triathlon\] Transition_. An ordered sequence of activities forms a multi-sport workout. However, most workouts may contain only a single activity.

Additionally, activity objects contain recorded data. Data collected from various sensors and data providers must be stored sequentially as **samples**. Activities may also contain **laps** and **markers**.

#### Top Level

The typical activity contains **sport**, **environment**, start date, and an array of **samples**.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `version` | string | ✓ | The URL of the version of the format the object. |
| `sport` | sport | ✓ | The sport of the activity. |
| `env` | environment | ✓ | The environment of the activity. |
| `start_date` | date | ✓ | Date when activity is started. This date may not match `t` value from the first sample, as data from the sensor may be delayed. |
| `samples` | \[sample\] | ✓ | Samples recorded during the activity ordered chronologically, oldest to newest. |
| `laps` | \[lap\] |  | Array of all laps. |
| `markers` | \[marker\] |  | Array of user markers. |
| `options` | \[string\] |  | Set of options that hint parser about how to approach data. |

### Activity Options

```javascript
{
  "sport": "cycle",
  "env": "outdoor",
  "options": ["raw", "PTVIx"],
  "start_date": "2019-04-20T04:20:42+00:00",
  "samples": [ 
    // { ... } 
  ],
}
```

#### General Options

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `raw` | Tells parser that data is not processed and might need smoothing. This usually indicates that the recorder didn't apply any filters when recording data from sensors. |
| `user_adjusted` | The contents of the activity are adjusted or modified by the user. Workout data should be presented as-is. |

{% hint style="info" %}
If the options key is missing or is empty, the parser must assume that data is presented in a raw state. Presented data might need filtering or smoothing.
{% endhint %}

#### Accessibility Options

Some activities can not be described completely using environment and sport alone. For such cases, `options` should provide more information.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `PTWCx` | Athlete uses a recumbent handcycle on the bike course and a racing wheelchair on the run segment \(in context of triathlon.\) |
| `PTSx` | In both bike and run segments \(in context of triathlon,\) amputee athletes use prosthesis or other supportive devices. |
| `PTVIx` | Athlete rides a tandem. |

### Sample

The sequence of ordered samples is the foundation of successful data analysis.

> Annotated example of a sample:

```javascript
{
  "t": 1555678832,    // datetime, unix epoch time
  "hr": 80,           // heart rate, bpm
  "s": 1.4,           // speed, m/s
  "l": {              // location object
    "lt": 36.486331,  // latitude
    "ln": 136.756827, // longitude
    "ha": 5           // horizontal accuracy, meters
  },
  "p": 200,           // power, watts
  "pb": 0.54,         // power left-right ratio
  "el": 0.2,          // elevation delta, meters
  "alt": 2314.2,      // altitude, meters
  "grd": 2.1,         // grade, % slope
  "at": 24.7,         // temperature, celsius
  "d": 3.12,          // displacement, meters
  "cd": 5001.4        // cumulative distance, meters
  "c": 80,            // cadecne, rpm
  "crs": 98.34        // course, degrees
}
```

| Key | Type | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `t` | datetime |  | MThe moment when sensors and data providers were sampled for the measurements. |
| `hr` | int | BPM | Heart rate measurement |
| `l` | location |  | Geographical 2D location of an athlete |
| `p` | double | W | Total power measurement |
| `pb` | double |  | Power bias, or distributions between left and right limbs. Must be ignored if the sample has no `p` measurement. |
| `c` | int | rpm | Cadence measurement |
| `s` | double | m/s | Speed measurement |
| `crs` | double | ºN | Course—the direction in which the athlete is traveling, measured in degrees and relative to due north. |
| `d` | double | m | Displacement—the distance from the last sample that contains `d` key. |
| `cd` | double | m | Cumulative distance—total distance covered from the start of the [activity](1.0.0-alpha.3.md#activity). |
| `alt` | double | m | Absolute altitude of an athlete from sea level. |
| `el` | double | m | Elevation—the altitude delta from the beginning of the activity. |
| `vosc` | double | cm | Vertical oscillation measurement \(part of running dynamics.\) |
| `gct` | double | ms | Ground contact time measurement—the time an athlete spends touching ground during the running stride \(part of running dynamics.\) |
| `stpl` | double | m | Step length—the length of the single stride \(part of running dynamics.\) |
| `grd` | double | % | Grade of the slope athlete is on. |
| `at` | double | ºC | Ambient temperature measurement. |

An empty sample is considered to be invalid and must be ignored. Non-empty sample must contain **`t` and at least one other measurement**. Sample containing the only `t` is also invalid and must be ignored.

#### Location

Example of a location object with a latitude, longitude, horizontal accuracy of 30 centimeters and vertical accuracy of 5 meters:

```javascript
{
  "lt": 35.679687,
  "ln": 139.757583,
  "ha": 0.3,
  "va": 5,
}
```

Location object describes a geographical location on a 2D plane. Location object may include 2D or 3D precision of the location. Precision values may help data analysis software to calculate an athlete's relative path in a more precise manner.

| Key | Type | Req. | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `lt` | double | ✓ | degrees | The latitude in degrees |
| `ln` | double | ✓ | degrees | The longitude in degrees |
| `ha` | double |  | m | Horizontal accuracy |
| `va` | double |  | m | Vertical accuracy |

It is recommended to store unprocessed location data from the sensors. Smoothing and other filtering techniques can be applied after data is decoded.

#### Displacement and Cumulative Distance

Unlike most fitness file formats, fitness·json supports two types of measurements to indicate athletes movement in terms of distance. TODO.

When activity is completed outdoors with good GPS data, both _cumulative distance_ and _displacement_ can be recalculated, adjusted, or ignored.

#### Latitude and Longitude Units

Positive values indicate latitudes north of the equator. Negative values indicate latitudes south of the equator.

#### Cadence Units

Cadence unit depends on the **sport**. For simplicity's sake, it is generalized as RPM \(revolutions per minute\). However, it could mean SPM \(steps per minute\) for running, and PPM \(pushes per minute\) for a wheelchair.

#### Power Bias

Power bias \(value of `pb`\), or power distribution is a ratio of work between athlete's left and right limbs. Value of `0.0` means that the athlete's right limb is doing all of the work and value of `1.0` means that the athlete's left limb is doing all of the work.

```javascript
{
  "t": 1555750866,
  "p": 234,
  "pb": 0.53
}
```

For instance, imagine athlete producing 234 watts on a bicycle equipped with a dual-side power meter. Power bias value is 0.53, meaning athlete is producing 124W \(53% of the total power\) with the left leg and 110W \(47%\) with the right leg.

A sample may not have power bias object while having value for `p`. Such a case, as an example, maybe be when the bicycle is equipped with a left-only power meter.

### Lap

> Typical lap event triggered by an athlete:

```javascript
{
  "t": "2019-04-20T04:20:42+00:00",
  "trigger": "manual"
}
```

Lap object describes an event. Lap events can be triggered manually by an athlete, or automatically—by fitness equipment or the [guide]().

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `t` | datetime | ✓ | Datetime of the event triggered |
| `trigger` | [lap\_trigger]() |  | DDescribes what or who triggered an event. |

#### Lap Trigger

Lap trigger describes means by which lap event was initiated.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `unknown` | **Default** value. Assumed when no `trigger` is present in lap object. |
| `manual` | Athlete pushed _Lap_ button. |
| `distance` | Distance based auto-lap feature of an app. |
| `timer` | Time based auto-lap feature of an app. |
| `position` | Geographical position or fence. |
| `equipment` | Fitness equipment requested start of new lap. |
| `guide` | **Guided workout** proceeded to next interval or block. |

### Marker

> Simple marker noting a particular moment:

```javascript
{
  "t":"2019-04-20T04:20:42+00:00"
}
```

> Marker with a note:

```javascript
{
  "t":"2019-04-20T04:20:42+00:00",
  "note": "Feels like I've hit the wall."
}
```

Marker object describes a specific point in time of the activity for the later reference. Marker object `t` value can be mapped to the corresponding sample and its measurements by the data analysis software.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `t` | datetime | ✓ | Moment of time to mark. |
| `trigger` | string |  | Short note. |

## Guide

Guide, or Guided Workout, is an object or file with a set of instructions of how the athlete should perform the activity. Guides are great tools for structured workouts as they can be as loose or as strict as the author designs them to be.

### Anatomy of Guide

There are couple of object object that make up a single guide.

👉 TODO: Visualization of the guide, its intervals, and blocks.

Guides consist of intervals and blocks. Intervals are groups of blocks. Blocks are atomic objects that describe a single step of work in the guide. A guide can be visualized as a sequence of blocks. Intervals group those blocks with shared environment, sport, and repeat count.

#### Top Level

```javascript
{
  "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.4#gudie",
  "title": "Tempo Ride",
  "symbol": "T1",
  "symbol_color": "#FF9900",
  "intervals": [
    {
      // ...
    }
  ],
  "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.",
  "author": {
    "name": "John Appleseed",
    "email": "johnappleseed@example.com",
    "link": "https://leopardskins-cyclingclub.org"
  },
  "created_at": "2019-04-21T00:41:57+00:00",
  "ref": "https://leopardskins-cyclingclub.org/guides/"
}
```

Non-empty guides must have at least one interval with at least one block. Otherwise, the guide is considered to be empty. The empty guide is not suitable for workout and should be ignored or edited.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `version` | string | ✓ | URL of the version of the format the object and/or file. |
| `title` | string |  | Title of the guide. |
| `symbol` | string |  | Abbreviation or shorthand code for easy guide identification. No more than two characters. |
| `symbol_color` | string |  | Color of the symbol for easy guide identification. A 16-bit, hexadecimal representation of the color. e.g. `#FF9900` for the orange. May not contain leading `#`. |
| `description` | string |  | A relatively long-form description of the guide. An excellent place to inform the athlete what this guide is trying to achieve, what to expect during the workout and any other information that may be useful for the athlete before she starts the workout. |
| `intervals` | interval | ✓ | An array of ordered intervals. |
| `author` | author |  | Name and contact information of the author of this guide. |
| `created_at` | datetime | ✓ | The date and time of guide creation. |
| `ref` | string |  | Reference URL pointing to any auxiliary or related information. |

### Interval

> Example of interval with two blocks that will be repeated twice in the workout.

```javascript
{
  "title": "Max Power",
  "env": "outdoor",
  "sport": "run",
  "repeats": 2,
  "blocks": [
    {
      // ...
    },
    { 
      // ...
    }
  ],
  "description": "Maximum effort followed by 2 min rest. Two sets. Go!"
}
```

Interval objects provide structure to the guide. They group related blocks, as well as tell the guide what environment and sport those blocks should be performed. Intervals also can have repeat count, thus eliminating the need to have duplicate groups of blocks in sequence.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `repeats` | int \[1..∞\)† |  | The number of repeats. Describes how many times a set of blocks should be repeated during a workout. |
| `title` | string |  | Title of the interval. |
| `sport` | sport | ✓ | Sport. |
| `env` | environment | ✓ | Environment. |
| `blocks` | block | ✓ | An array of ordered blocks that are part of this interval. |
| `description` | string |  | Short instruction and overview of the block for the athlete. |

#### Repeats

When `repeat` has a value greater than `1`, the guide should put the interval's first block in the queue right after its last block. Only after all blocks in the interval has been performed `repeat` times, the guide player must advance to the next interval \(first block of the next interval\). This process should repeat until the guide has run out of blocks and their parent intervals.

`repeat` is optional, and when absent from the object, the decoder should assume the value of `1`. Values less than `1` are invalid.

### Block

```javascript
{
  "type" : "work",
  "duration" : {
    "condition" : "gte",
    "trigger" : "distance",
    "value" : 5000
  },
  "target_type" : "rvalue",
  "target_rvalue" : {
    "anchor" : "threshold",
    "lower" : 0.95,
    "upper" : 1.05,
    "metric" : "heart_rate"
  },
  "description" : "Run for 5K. Try to be near your LTHR.",
}
```

Block object, or work block, describes a single unit of work in the guide. 

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `type` | type | ✓ | Type of the block. Describes the kind of work to perform. |
| `duration` | duration | ✓ | The condition upon meeting which block is complete and guide advances to the next block. |
| `target_type` | target\_type | ✓ | Type of the target. |
| `target_value` | value\_target |  | The object describing target when `target_type` is `value`. |
| `target_rvalue` | rvalue\_target |  | The object describing target when `target_type` is `rvalue`. |
| `target_zone` | zone\_target |  | The object describing target when `target_type` is `zone`. |
| `description` | string |  | Short instruction and overview of the block. |

Block can be one of *several types*, have completion condition, and optionally, target too. Targets itself, can be *one of four types*.

#### Block Type

Block type object describes the nature of work in the current block. Those are provided mostly for visual reference. Type of work does has effect on completion duration, nor on target.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `warmup` | Warm-up |
| `work` | Relatively hi-intensity activity |
| `rest` | Lower intensity activity |
| `cooldown` | Cool down |

### Block Completion

The guide can advance by automatically or manually. Block completion object describes exact instructions on how the block should advance to the next block in the guide.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `trigger` | trigger | ✓ | What triggers advancement to the next block. |
| `condition` | condition |  | What conditions should be satisfied by the trigger. |
| `value` | double |  | Value of measurement based on which condition is applied. |

#### Trigger

Example of a cool down block that ends when the athlete's heart rate drops below 60 BPM:

```javascript
{
  "duration": {
    "trigger": "heart_rate",
    "condition": "lt",
    "value": 60
  },
  "description": "Run for 5K",
  "type": "cooldown",
  "target_type": "none"
}
```

Event or measurement that triggers the advancement to the next block or guide completion. When the trigger is set to `user`, the guide will not advance automatically. It is good practice to remind athletes about that using the block's description object. Athlete can manually advance to the next block irrespective what trigger value is.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `user` | Athlete requests next block. |
| `time` | Block timer. |
| `distance` | Block distance. |
| `hr` | Live heart rate. |
| `block_hr` | Block average heart rate. |
| `speed` | Live speed or pace. |
| `block_speed` | Block average speed or pace. |
| `cadence` | Live cadence. |
| `power` | Live power. |
| `power3` | Live power average of last 3 seconds. |
| `power10` | Live power average of last 10 seconds. |
| `power30` | Live power average of last 30 seconds. |
| `block_power` | Block average power. |

#### Condition

> Example of the block that advances to the next block after 5K:

```javascript
{
  "duration": {
    "trigger": "distance",
    "condition": "gte", // note `gte` instead of `eq`
    "value": 5000
  },
  "description": "Run for 5K",
  "type": "work",
  "target_type": "none"
}
```

You could read out loud above block's completion condition like so:

> _“This block will be done when athlete covers the **distance** that **is greater than or equal** to **5000 meters**.”_

Condition object describes an operator that is applied to the measurement and value of value object in the block completion.

| Value | Symbol | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `lt` | &lt; | Less than. |
| `lte` | ≤ | Less than or equal to. |
| `eq` | = | Strictly equal to. |
| `gte` | ≥ | Greater than or equal to. |
| `gt` | &gt; | Greater than. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Equality \(`eq`\) is strict equality. When designing blocks that are complete at after 5000 meters, guide designer must use greater than or equal to condition operator instead of equal to as recorder might sample distance values just before and after athlete passes 5K mark. Neither 4998.9 not 5000.4 are strictly equal to 5000, thus block will never end.

### Block Targets

Example block without a target has a duration of two minutes:

```javascript
{
  "type": "work",
  "target_type": "none",
  "duration": {
    "trigger": "time",
    "condition": "gte",
    "value": 120
  },
  "description": "Simply run for two minutes.",
}
```

Block object can have one of four types of targets as described in `target_type`.

| Value | `object` Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`none`]() | N/A | Block has no target \(a.k.a. _Free Block_.\) |
| [`value`]() | `target_value` | The athlete is asked to be in the range of specific numbers for the given **metric**. |
| [`rvalue`]() | `target_rvalue` | The athlete is asked to be the range that is calculated by multiplying relative values to fitness values from the **profile** of the given **metric** and **anchor**. |
| [`zone`]() | `target_zone` | The athlete is asked to hit zone at the given index. Zone index is independent of the athlete's choice zone set. The guide should specify what zone-set it is designed to work. |

Unless `none` is a value of `target_type`, the block must have a corresponding target object as its content.

#### No Target \(Free Block\)

No target block. The athlete may do whatever they want. This kind of block is useful when actual goal of the block is to just complete the block.

#### Absolute Value Target

Example of block with `target_type: value`. An athlete is asked to maintain heart rate within 80–100 BPM range for 20 minutes:

```javascript
{
  "type": "work",
  "target_type": "value",
  "target_value": {
    "metric": "heart_rate",
    "lower": 80,
    "upper": 100,
  },
  "duration": { "trigger": "time", "condition": "gte", "value": 1200 }
}
```

Absolute value target object describes the specific range of values of a given **metric** that athlete should aim.

All fields are required.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `metric` | metric | Target metric |
| `lower` | double | Lower bound |
| `upper` | double | Upper bound \(exclusive\) |

While absolute value targets are straightforward and easy to understand, note that it is infrequent when the same values work for different athletes. If you intent to share the guide online, consider using **Relative Value Target** objects as they calculate absolute ranges based on an athlete's profile.

#### Relative Value Target

> Example of the block with `target_type: rvalue`. An athlete is asked to maintain 90–110% of her FTP during 2 minutes:

```javascript
{
  "type": "work",
  "target_type": "rvalue",
  "target_value": {
    "metric": "power",
    "anchor": "threshold",
    "lower": 0.9,
    "upper": 1.1,
  },
  "duration": { "trigger": "time", "condition": "gte", "value": 120 }
}
```

Unlike absolute value target, relative values targets are calculated based on data points from the athlete's **profile**. They can be universal for many types among the people and automatically update as an athlete's physique and fitness changes over time. As with absolute values, the target range is set with `lower` and `upper` bound values, but instead of exact measurements, they contain _multipliers_. Those get multiplied by a measurement from profile based on the combination of values from `metric` and `anchor`.

For instance, if the value of `metric` is `power` and value of `anchor` is `threshold`, then multipliers from the target's `lower` and `upper` are applied to the **profile**'s `ftp` value.

All fields are required.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `metric` | metric | Target metric |
| `anchor` | anchor | Relative to what profile measurement |
| `lower` | double | Lower bound multiplier |
| `upper` | double | Upper bound multiplier \(exclusive\) |

#### Zone Target

> Example of the block with `target_type: zone`. An athlete is asked to maintain heart rate zone 3 for 4 kilometers:

```javascript
{
  "type": "work",
  "target_type": "zone",
  "target_value": {
    "metric": "heart_rate",
    "index": 3,
  },
  "duration": { "trigger": "distance", "condition": "gte", "value": 4000 }
}
```

Zone Target object describes which zone athlete should aim for, and what kind of zone it should be. Note that the value of `index` is an index of a zone in an array of zones in a zone-set. Meaning, if an athlete replaces zone set with a different one, a new zone that is located at the same index of `index` becomes the new target zone. It is an athlete's responsibility to make sure that selected zone set matches requirements of the target and guide.

All fields are required.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `metric` | metric | Type of metric of which zone should be used. |
| `index` | int | Index of a selected zone-set. |

#### Metric

Metric object describes what type of measurement target value range is.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `heart_rate` | Heart rate |
| `cadence` | Cadence — RPM for cycling and handcycle; SPM for running; PPM for wheelchair. |
| `power` | Power. |
| `speed` | Speed or pace. |

#### Metric Anchor

Anchor object describes relative to which data point in athlete's **profile** the final target range should be calculated against.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `min` | An athlete's minimum measured value for the metric \(e.g. **Resting HR** when `metric: heart_rate`.\) |
| `max` | An athlete's maximum measured value for the metric \(e.g. **MaxHR** when `metric: heart_rate`.\) |
| `threshold` | An athlete's threshold value for the metric \(e.g. **FTP** when `metric: power` and `sport: cycle`.\) |
| `test` | Test time measurement \(e.g. swim test time\) |

There are many combinations of `metric` and `anchor` that do not make sense. Such cases should be handled with care. For instance, what is minimum power? Minimum power athlete can produce is always equal to 0 watts \(i.e., not pedaling.\) Anchoring a target range on 0 watts is not particularly useful since both, lower and upper bounds always equal to 0.

## Profile

Example of an athlete's complete profile:

```javascript
{
    "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.4#profile",
    "name": "John Appleseed",
    "email": "johnappleseed@example.com",
    "link": "https://johnappleseed.me",
    "profile_picture_url": "https://johnappleseed.me/images/avatar.jpg",
    "hrr": 48,
    "hrmax": 201,
    "lthr": 169,
    "ftp": 220,
    "rftpw": 240,
    "vo2max": 39,
    "weight": 74.4,
    "height": 170,
    "swim_test_dist": 1000,
    "swim_test_time": 500,
    "run_tpace": 4.7,
    "birthday": "1988-04-17",
    "sex": "male",
    "wheelchair": false,
    "handcycle": false
}
```

Example of the minimal profile for a cyclist:

```javascript
{
    "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.2.0#profile",
    "lthr": 169,
    "ftp": 220,
    "vo2max": 39,
    "weight": 74.4,
}
```

Profile object describes various athlete's measurements and data points. Profile object features several arbitrary categories: basic body measurements, fitness test results, accessibility information, and contact information.

Profile object is not a database; hence there is no historical information in it. When faced with a profile without any context, the decoder should assume that profile has _latest known data_. When profile object is part of another object \(for instance, a **workout**\), then the decoder can map the parent object's date to the profile.

#### Top Level

Since profile may be embedded into other objects, **all values are optional**.

| Key | Type | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `version` | url |  | URL of the version of the format the object. |
| `name` | string |  | Full name of an athlete. |
| `email` | string |  | Contact email of an athlete. |
| `link` | string |  | Website of an athlete. |
| `profile_picture_url` | string |  | Profile picture URL of an athlete.  |
| `birthday` | datetime|  | Date of birth. |
| `sex` | sex |  | Biological sex of an athlete. |
| `hrr` | int | BPM | Resting heart rate. |
| `hrmax` | int | BPM | Maximum heart rate. |
| `lthr` | int | BPM | Lactate threshold heart rate, LTHR. |
| `ftp` | int | W | Cycling threshold power, FTP. |
| `rftpw` | int | W | Running functional threshold power, rFTPw. |
| `vo2max` | int | mL/\(kg·min\) | Maximal oxygen consumption of an athlete. |
| `weight` | int | kg | Weight of an athlete. |
| `swim_test_dist` | double | m | Distance of the swim test. |
| `swim_test_time` | double | s | Recorded completion time of the swim test \(for the distance.\) |
| `run_tpace` | double | m/s | Running threshold pace. |
| `wheelchair` | bool |  | `true` when athlete is a wheelchair user. No key of this key is equivalent of `false`. |
| `handcycle` | bool |  | `true` when athlete is a handcycle user. No key of this key is equivalent of `false`. |

`swim_test_dist` and `swim_test_time` are only interdependent values in the profile object. They are considered as valid only if both are present.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Developers should pay extra attention when sharing profile to other parties or apps, as it may contain highly private information, both from user privacy, and competitive perspective. **Do not share a profile object in any form without user consent. Make sure users understand what data is shared on every occasion.**
{% endhint %}

## Route

Example of a route with single POI and two paths:

```javascript
{
  "version": "https://fitnessjson.org/version/1.0.0-alpha.4#route",
  "name": "Sunday Group Ride (Spring 2019)",
  "description": "Note for new members: we'll take alternative path starting from 30km point (marked so) to avoid two climbs.",
  "paths": [
    {
      "waypoints": [
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
      ],
      "name": "Main Cycling Path",
      "color": "#F7C948"
    },
    {
      "waypoints": [
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
        { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
      ],
      "name": "Novice Detour",
      "color": "#8DED2D"
    }
  ],
  "poi": [
    {
      "coordinate": { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
      "name": "Coffee Stop",
      "color": "#E67635"
    }
  ],
  "ref": "https://leopardskins-cyclingclub.org/ride/1234"
}
```

Routes are geographical information about paths and POIs \(points-of-interest\) used as a map overlay while performing an activity. Routes shouldn't require specific workouts but may have additional information. The primary use of the route is to serve as additional geographical information for an athlete regardless of activity or sport. Example paths could be weekly sunday bike ride route with its alternative loops, resting places, and coffee-stop locations.

The athlete may choose to use routes as an assistance to a guided workout and have POIs indicating starts or ends of significant efforts or target heart rate zones.

#### Top Level

Route files are self-contained and are not part of any other file or object. However, completed workouts can contain routes as a reference to its geographical data.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `version` | url | ✓ | URL of the version of the format the file. |
| `name` | string |  | Title of the route file. |
| `description` | string |  | Descriptive, multiline text. |
| `paths` | \[path\] |  | Array of paths that are part of the route. |
| `pois` | \[poi\] |  | Array of points of interest. |
| `ref` | string |  | Reference URL. |

### Path

The path is a representation of a single, uninterrupted track within a route, presented as a colored line with a short name that describes it.

> Example of a short path that is made of six waypoints:

```javascript
{
  "waypoints": [
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 },
    { "lt": 36.486331, "ln": 136.756827 }
  ],
  "name": "Main Cycling Path",
  "color": "#F7C948"
}
```

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `waypoints` | location | ✓ | An array of ordered coordinates that make up the path. |
| `name` | string |  | Short title. |
| `color` | string |  | A 16-bit, hexadecimal representation of the color. e.g. `#FF9900` for the orange. May not contain leading `#`. |

Order of coordinates in `waypoints` is essential. The path is made by connecting previous waypoint to the current one. After that cursor is advanced to the next waypoint and process is repeated until the waypoints array is exhausted.

Each path is uninterrupted. User can use multiple paths with the same `name` and `color` if such behavior is required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Horizontal and vertical accuracy values \(`ha` and `va` \), when used describing path will be ignored. Path objects must have accurate coordinates.
{% endhint %}

### POI

POI, or Point of Interest, is a representation of a single place on the route, presented as a color dot with a short name that describes it. POIs are designed to be glance-able and straightforward during the activity.

> Example of a café near Kanazawa:

```javascript
{
  "coordinate": {
    "lt": 36.486331,
    "ln": 136.756827
  },
  "name": "1st Coffee Stop",
  "color": "#E67635"
}
```

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `coordinate` | location | ✓ | Coordinate of the place. |
| `name` | string |  | Short title. |
| `color` | string |  | A 16-bit, hexadecimal representation of the color. e.g. `#FF9900` for the orange. May not contain leading `#`. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Horizontal and vertical accuracy values \(`ha` and `va` \), when used describing POI will be ignored. POI objects must have accurate coordinates.
{% endhint %}

## Common Data Types

### DateTime

DateTime, date, or just `t`, should be specified as a string in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format or [UNIX Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

In cases where DateTime repeats frequently, or sub-second precision is required, the encoder should use UNIX time format. It is a good practice to use ISO 8601 in all cases but in **samples**, where UNIX Time is advantageous as the value of `t`.

### Sport

Following sports are supposed by fitness·json:

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `run` | Running |
| `cycle` | Cycling on a two-wheeled bicycle. |
| `swim` | Any style of swimming. |
| `walk` | Walking. Maybe a slow-paced stroll, tracking, or racewalking |
| `transition` | Activity performed in between two different disciplines, as in triathlon. Should be treated synonymous to running when no accessibility options are present |
| `wheelchair` | Race pace wheelchair |
| `handcycle` | Handcycling |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Wheelchair and handcycle are distinct types of activity and must not be replaced by `run` and `cycle` respectively. fitness·json format respects para-sport as-is and treats them as first-class citizens.
{% endhint %}

### Environment

The environment activity is performed in.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `indoor` | Performed indoors. Usually means that GPS data is not available or should be ignored. |
| `outdoor` | Performed outdoors, where GPS information and atmospheric conditions matter or provide context. |
| `virtual` | Performed in virtual environments such as computer games, simulations, etc. GPS data is simulated. |

### Sex

Biological sex may be useful when calculating calorie burn during the workouts. Ideally, this metric should be highly optional and not required. Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `unknown` | **Default** value |
| `male` | Male |
| `female` | Female |
| `other` | Athlete explicitly declined to provide sex information. |

**Difference between `unknown` and `other`**

Value of `unknown` is assumed as the default value when the athlete does not provide sex. This value of `unknown` grants application to make an educated guess of the athlete's biological sex if it is beneficial to the data analysis. Value of `other`, explicitly tells the decoder that sex-based data analysis must be avoided as they are inaccurate or not appropriate for the athlete.

### Author / Person

Example of complete author object:

```javascript
{
  "name": "Joana Appleseed",
  "email": "joanaappleseed@example.com",
  "link": "https://leopardskinz-cyclingclub.org",
  "profile_picture_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/jina/128.jpg"
}
```

Author, or **person**, object describes and identifies a person and their contact information.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `name` | string |  | Full name of a person. |
| `email` | string |  | Contact email of a person. |
| `link` | string |  | Home web page, blog, or social account. |
| `profile_picture_url` | string |  | URL string of the profile image. Should not be a large file. |

### Comment

> Example of comment object:

```javascript
{
  "date": "2019-04-21T04:37:13+00:00",
  "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",  
  "author": {
    "name": "Joana Appleseed",
    "email": "joanaappleseed@example.com",
    "link": "https://leopardskins-cyclingclub.org",
    "profile_picture_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/jina/128.jpg"
  }
}
```

Comment, or **note**, object describes and short textual memo that can be attached to various objects, usually **workouts**.

| Key | Type | Req. | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `date` | datetime | ✓ | Date memo was created. |
| `text` | string | ✓ | Contents of the memo. |
| `author` | author |  | Author of the memo. |

When `author` is not present in comment object, the decoder should assume the athlete herself authored a comment as a post-workout note.
